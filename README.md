## Obesity Classification in Adults using Machine Learning 
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), obesity is defined as an excess of adiposity, or a build-up of body fat that is detrimental to one's health (World Health Organisation, 2023). Obesity is classified using the body mass index (BMI), a commonly used indicator of body fat. In particular, according to WHO rules, a person is considered obese if their BMI is greater than 30 kg/m2. Obesity has become a major global health and economic concern (Ward et al., 2019). It is defined by the buildup of body fat, which affects people of all ages and is one of the biggest health issues of the twenty-first century (Atay and Bereket 2016). 
An energy imbalance between calories utilised and calories ingested is the primary cause of overweight and obesity. The global obesity and overweight epidemic is a result of rising energy-dense food consumption, sedentary lifestyles and work, and urbanisation (WHO, 2018a). 
Around 42% of the world's population aged 20 and up were overweight or obese in 2020, according to estimates. This figure is predicted to increase to 46% by 2035. Furthermore, the worldwide economic effect of overweight and obesity is expected to increase from 1.96 trillion US dollars in 2020 to 4.32 trillion US dollars in 2035 (Statista 2025). In 2022, 2.5 billion adults aged 18 and over were overweight, with over 890 million suffering from obesity. This equates to 43% of adults aged 18 and older (43% of males and 44% of women) being overweight (WHO 2025). 

## Problem Statement 
Obesity has become a critical public health issue in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. The rapidly rising prevalence of obesity in these countries is closely linked to urbanization, changing diets characterized by the consumption of highly processed foods, and reduced physical activity levels. In Mexico, recent studies have indicated that over 35% of the adult population is classified as obese, a situation exacerbated by socio-economic disparities and insufficient public health interventions, Parra et al. (2017) Kline et al. (2017). Similarly, Peru experiences an alarming increase in obesity rates, with a reported prevalence of 28% among adults, leading to significant health implications such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (Corval√°n et al., 2017). Colombia presents a similar trend, with obesity rates climbing to approximately 27%, driven by environmental factors and lifestyle changes as urbanization progresses (Kline et al., 2017; Llorca-Colomer et al., 2022). Notably, the classification of obesity through Body Mass Index (BMI) may not fully capture the underlying health risks, as emerging evidence suggests that the accumulation of body fat, rather than weight alone, is a crucial determinant of health outcomes (Itani et al., 2020; Jaacks et al., 2019). Despite the awareness of obesity's profound health consequences, research capacity for advanced preventive strategies is limited in Latin America, necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to effectively combat this epidemic (Kee et al., 2017).
Recent studies have highlighted the potential of machine learning (ML) as a promising approach for predicting obesity risk by leveraging large datasets that combine demographic, behavioral, and physiological variables. Cheng et al. Cheng et al. (2022) emphasized that classifiers utilizing machine-learning methodologies can effectively discern intricate relationships among risk factors related to obesity, providing a nuanced understanding that traditional models might overlook.
Therefore, this study aims to develop a robust ML classification model to predict obesity risk levels by analyzing diverse lifestyle attributes, dietary habits, and anthropometric data, thereby augmenting existing predictive frameworks and systematically addressing the growing obesity epidemic.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are:

1. To apply machine learning classification algorithms to predict obesity risk levels.
 
2. To evaluate the performance of different classification models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   
3. To develop an interpretable model that can provide insights into key factors influencing obesity risk.
